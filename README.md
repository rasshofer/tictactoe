# Tic Tac Toe AI Android App

> A simple Tic Tac Toe Android app written in Java, allowing you to play against an AI bot.

## Deprecation (* 2014 † 2014)

Please note that this app (+ repository) is abandoned and no longer maintained. The app was a homework assignment back in my good old university days that I built within one afternoon. I never touched the code again ever since and do not plan to do so in the future. This repository is kept alive in order to provide an exemplary implementation to others with similar assignments looking for inspiration.

[The app is on the Google Play Store in case you’re interested in giving it a try.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.no_magic.tictactoe)
